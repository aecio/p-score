# P-Score: reputation-based ranking on graphs

P-score is a ranking algorithm based on the notion of reputation and random walks on graphs.
This is a implementation of the algorithms from the paper:

Sabir Ribas, Berthier Ribeiro-Neto, Rodrygo L. T. Santos, Edmundo de Souza e Silva, Alberto Ueda, Nivio Ziviani. **Random Walks on the Reputation Graph**, *Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on The Theory of Information Retrieval (ICTIR)*, 2015.

Currently, only the version of the algorithm for *bipartite graphs* is implemented.
